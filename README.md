# BIOS-Multitool

## ‚ùì Information

BIOS-Multitool was made in 7/23/24 as of now it is one of my first attempts at a multi-tool so I would not have your hopes up of it being fast or efficant this is currently a solo project and it is coded in python
It's only current developer is "Lox" also known as oxverdose,opeartion or vlowr.
This is starting out as a discord multi-tool but may evolve into other things.

## ‚ùó I found a bug or need help with something what do I do?

If you found a bug or need help with anything you can head to https://discord.gg/dQgPzqgxge to get help with anything you need!

## ü§¢ The way you described it why should I download and use this?

Well really you don't have to but if you want to see the project grow and support me it would help alot if you at least tried it and you can delete it right after using the uninstaller!

## üòü Can I trust it though?

Yes you can 100% trust my program all-though I can not make you trust it I can give you some tools you can use to scan it etc.

## üíø How much does this slow my computer down when its running and when I close it does it stay in the background?

Well since this project is in BETA expect it to slow your computer down a bit but I am working on making it more fast and efficant for its users and no it does not stay in the background it fully closes so you got nothing to worry about there.
